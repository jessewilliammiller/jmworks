                <p> Born in Uganda, I was steeped in the kalimba-driven music of the Luo people,
                    as well as the ceturies-old hymns of my Mennonite familiy. After settling in Michigan, I got my first guitar at eight years old and started playing in
                    emulation of my dad, a musician and luthier by avocation. My education continued after moving to Waco, TX, with Texas Swing legend Kenny Frazier, whose lessons emphasized music theory and
                    improvisation. I devoured everything from
                    Miles to Lil Wayne to The Beatles. I attended the University of North Texas, studying guitar,
                    composition, and West African drumming. Now based in Seattle, I create music as JM Fodder, and perform frequently as a sideman across the Pacific Northwest. My inclusivity regarding genre drives me to create new music
                    that is pointedly distinct from my latest works. I have recently immersed myself in
                    creating electronic music. My latest album, Our Fodder, out in March 2023, uses Ableton Live to present
                    improvised avant-garde electronic dance music. </p>
